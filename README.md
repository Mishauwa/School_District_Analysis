# School_District_Analysis
Python Analysis of school data










After cleaning the data and removing duplicates and NAN (mostly missing reading and maths scores by students) we could start the anlaysis with a clean set. 

Findings:
    - The average budget between charter and public schools is nearly the same 
    - In the amount of students per school is a high variation between the schools (min: 171 max: 2038)
    - The average math_score is not highly affected by the school type (public or charter)
Additional Analysis:
    - Compare whether the number of students per school is affecting reading or math scores 
    - Compare reading and math scores between the schools and their school budgets
